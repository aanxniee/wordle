# ðŸ“– Wordle

Original credit to Josh Wardle. Made using C++ and Libcurl. Utilizes HTTPS GET to generate a random word from [Random Words API](https://rapidapi.com/sheharyar566/api/random-words5). Explores sending and receiving HTTPS requests via C++ and C++ console formatting.

To try this out, clone this repository and create a config.h file with your own API token. You must also have Libcurl installed. Run the program by using:
```
g++ wordle.cpp -o wordle -lcurl
./wordle
```
